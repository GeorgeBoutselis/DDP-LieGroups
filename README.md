## DDP on Lie groups

Implementation of the geometric version of Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) for trajectory optimization. Application on a simple mechanical system on TSO(3).

### Prerequisites

The scripts were tested on MATLAB R2016a.

### Usage

* `main_ddpLie.m` runs the main algorithm for different orders of dynamics approximations.
* `test_noise.m` tests the obtained solution on noisy dynamics.
