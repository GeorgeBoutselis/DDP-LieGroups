# ${1:Differential Dynamic Programming on Lie groups}
Performs trajectory optimization of a simple mechanical system on TSO(3) via the geometric version of Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP).
## Prerequisites
The codes were coded and tested on MATLAB R2016a.
## Usage
`main_ddpLie.m` runs the main algorithm for different orders of dynamics approximations.
`test_noise.m` tests the obtained solution on noisy dynamics.
